# HTML Basics Overview

Welcome to the HTML Basics unit!

## Preview

In the next few lessons, we'll be introducing you to HTML (or, **H**yper**t**ext
**M**arkup **L**anguage).

HTML is a _documentation-based_ technology. The word _documentation_ probably
inspires a mental image of someone carrying heaps of papers, folders, files.
But what is a _document_ in the digital realm?

We'll start our exploration of HTML by thinking about files. Doing so will
teach us essential HTML terms. Knowing these words helps us search better.  It
also helps us talk to mentors the way they expect.

We'll do a lab where you'll be guided in editing a simple HTML document. 
Don't try to memorize everything! We want to share the joy of being able to
adjust HTML and see the result.

After that, we'll learn a core set of HTML features that will enable you to create
simple HTML documents with less-explicit guidance. Around this time, you'll then
begin tying these discoveries together and will start generating your first
HTML documents.

## Repetition &amp; Getting Stuck

In these lessons ahead some ideas are repeated. We're trying to make sure you
get the hang of things.  If you don't get "attributes" the first time you see
them maybe you will the second time.  Some hands-on experience may have changed
your comfort!

## Beyond

By the end of the unit you'll be ready to create **big** web pages. You'll be a
fresh member into the world of HTML authors!
